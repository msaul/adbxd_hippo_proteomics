        abstract = {The challenge of precision medicine is to model complex interactions among DNA variants, sets of phenotypes, and complex environmental factors and confounders. We have expanded the BXD family, creating a powerful and extensible test bed for experimental precision medicine and an ideal cohort to study gene-by-environmental interactions.These BXD segregate for over 6 million variants, with a mean minor allele frequency close to 0.5. We have increased the family two-fold to 150 inbred strains, all derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. We have also generated updated and comprehensive genotypes and an unrivaled deep phenome.Approximately 10,000 recombinations have been located, allowing precision of quantitative trait loci mapping of ±2.0 Mb over much of the genome and ±0.5 Mb for Mendelian loci. The BXD phenome includes more than 100 ‘omics data sets and \&gt;7000 quantitative and clinical phenotypes, all of which is publicly available.The BXD family is an enduring, collaborative, and replicable resource to test causal and mechanistic links between genomes and phenomes at many stages and under a wide variety of treatments and interventions.List of abbreviationsADAlzheimer’s DiseaseAIadvanced intercrossB6C57BL/6J mouse strainBLASTBasic Local Alignment Search ToolBXDBXD family of recombinant inbred strains of mice, produced by crossing the B6 and D2 parental strainsCCCollaborative CrossChrChromosomecMcentimorganD2DBA/2J mouse strainDODiversity OutbredDXdiallel crossEMRselectronic medical recordseQTLExpression quantitative trait locusF2Filial generation 2GEMMAGenome-wide Efficient Mixed Model AssociationGigaMUGAGiga Mouse Universal Genotyping ArrayGNGeneNetwork (http://genenetwork.org)GN2GeneNetwork2 (http://gn2.genenetwork.org)GWASgenome-wide association studyH2ix̅heritability of isogenic strain meansH2RIx̅heritability of recombinant inbred strain meansHMDPHybrid Mouse Diversity PanelIMPCInternational Mouse Phenotyping ConsortiumJAXThe Jackson LaboratoryKbkilobaseKOMPKnockout Mouse projectLODlogarithm of oddsLRSlikelihood ratio statisticMbMegabaseMMRRCMutant Mouse Resource \&amp; Research CentersMUGAMouse Universal Genotyping ArraynRecPnumber of observed recombinations from one position to the nextnRecSnumber of observed recombinations per strainPheWASphenome-wide association studiesQTquantitative traitQTLquantitative trait locusr2Coefficient of determinationRIRecombinant inbredRIXsRecombinant inbred intercrossesSEStandard error of the meanSNPsingle nucleotide polymorphismUTHSCUniversity of Tennessee Health Science Center},
